# Bootsmacss
A starting point for people who prefer to write their own [s]css - [link](https://github.com/QuackMartins/bootsmacss)

## First steps
Primarily we need to understand bootsmacss objective. 

Bootsmacss target is to supply boilerplate `.scss` following 
[SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) style guide. This projects also contains some
`README.md` files inside key directories for clarification.

## How to use it in my project?
All you need to do is simply copy the `styles` folder into your project.

We intentionally don't provide a `bower`/`package.json` because
bootsmacss won't be a dependency. If you want to use some "framework" css,
this repo is not for you :'(
